### âœ¨ About Me

Welcome! I'm an avid explorer of both code and the world. Whether it's new technologies or new countries, I'm always on the move to explore!

I am a recent CS Grad from Northeastern University. I am passionate about building scalable, data-driven applications. I look forward to working at a leading technology company where I can contribute to solving challenging problems and grow as a Software Engineer. My experience includes designing robust backend systems and leveraging AI & Machine Learning to drive efficiency. I've designed and implemented event-driven microservices and built ML models to automate digital products & customer interaction workflows. 

I thrive on turning ideas into reality, from award-winning hackathon projects to complex system integrations. Recommendations given to me, highlight my maturity as an engineer, consistent performance, and ability to take up tasks with a great sense of responsibility. I am also praised for remaining calm under pressure, delivering under time constraints, and exhibiting extreme ownership. With a strong foundation in Java, Python, Cloud computing, and AI, I am ready to tackle new challenges and make a meaningful contribution to a forward-thinking team.
