### âœ¨ About Me

Welcome! I'm an avid explorer of both code and the world. Whether it's new technologies or new countries, I'm always on the move to explore!

I am a Computer Software Engineering Graduate Student at Northeastern University. My key areas of interest are Software Development, Software Design and Java Programming and I am aligning my coursework at Northeastern University to enhance and deepen my skills along with learning new industry trending technologies. I have 1.5 years of work experience as a Software Developer Engineer and 6 months of internship experience at First Help Financial (both Fin-Tech Product Startups). I have worked on building reliable and performant backend microservices using Java Spring for the Debt & Loan Origination Banking Products. Working in the Financial sector has provided me with the opportunities to learn and develop solutions for real-world applications.

I am a problem solver and I love finding solutions to new and exciting problem statements. I am skilled in Data Structures and Algorithms, Object Oriented Programming, Java Programming, Microservices & REST API Development, Design Patterns, Software Development, and System Design. Recommendations given to me, highlight my maturity as an engineer, consistent performance, and ability to take up tasks with a great sense of responsibility. I am also praised for remaining calm under pressure, delivering under time constraints, and exhibiting extreme ownership.
